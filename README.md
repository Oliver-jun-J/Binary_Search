# Binary_Search
This mini project is about a binary seach problem

# What is binary search:
Binary search is a way of finding a specific element in a sorted array. 
The steps are:
* 1. compare the middle number of the array with the wanted value, and discard the half of the array that doesn't contain the value.
* 2. set the other half of the array as the target array.
* 3. go back to step 1 and do it over and over again until we find the position of the desired value.
